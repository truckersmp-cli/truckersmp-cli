# truckersmp-cli

A simple launcher for [TruckersMP][truckersmp] to play ATS or ETS2 in multiplayer.

_truckersmp-cli_ allows to download TruckersMP and handles starting TruckersMP through [Wine][wine] while supporting the Windows versions of [American Truck Simulator][steam:ats] and [Euro Truck Simulator 2][steam:ets2].

The [Windows version of Steam][steam:windows] should already be able to run in the same Wine prefix.
The Windows versions of ATS and ETS2 can be installed and updated via [SteamCMD][steam:steamcmd] while all running Steam processes will be stopped to prevent Steam from loosing connection. Your Steam password and guard code are required by SteamCMD once for this to work.

On Linux it's possible to start TruckersMP through [Proton][github:proton]. A working [native Steam][repology:steam] installation is needed for this which has the desired game [installed or with an update pending][github:issue253]. SteamCMD can use your saved credentials for convenience.

## Known issues

* When Proton is used, DLCs don't work without installing the native version of the game. A pending download is also sufficient. For the details, see [issue #253][github:issue253].
* If D3D11 rendering backend is used, TruckersMP login screen is not shown without Windows native 64-bit `d3dcompiler_47.dll`
    * `truckersmp-cli` will automatically download and set up the Windows native dll when D3D11 is used
* If Steam is running while SteamCMD is being used the Steam client looses all connections and maybe asks for the password and the guard code at the next startup. This script closes all Steam processes before acting with SteamCMD so **starting an update with a shortcut out of the Steam client won't work** because Steam waits for the script to finish and the script waits for Steam to quit.
* If there are game MOD files with German umlauts `ü` and `ß` in filename, game crashes on German locale. For the details, see [issue #248][github:issue248].

## Build

1. Clone or download this repository
1. Run `make` in the main folder to build the injector executable. Bash/zsh completion files will also be generated.
1. Optional run [`setup.py`][setuptools:command-reference] to manually start the installation process.

### Buildtime dependencies

#### Required

* [`gcc-mingw-w64`][repology:gcc-mingw-w64] to build the injector executable
* [`make`][repology:make]

#### Optional

* [`git`][repology:git] to clone this repo and help developing
* [`setuptools`][repology:python-setuptools] to run `setup.py`

### bash/zsh completion

`make` generates shell completion files for bash (bash-completion) and zsh. They enable tab-completion of available positional arguments and command-line options.

#### System-wide installation

Shell|System-wide search paths
---|---
bash|`$(pkg-config --variable=completionsdir bash-completion)` (e.g. `/usr/share/bash-completion/completions/`), `/usr/local/share/bash-completion/completions/`
zsh|`/usr/share/zsh/site-functions/`, `/usr/local/share/zsh/site-functions/`

* The bash-completion file `truckersmp-cli.bash` needs to be renamed to `truckersmp-cli`
* Debian-based systems are using the `/usr/share/zsh/vendor-completions/` directory for zsh completions

#### Per-user installation

##### bash

Copy `truckersmp-cli.bash` to `$XDG_DATA_HOME/bash-completion/completions/truckersmp-cli`.

```
$ mkdir -p "${XDG_DATA_HOME:-~/.local/share}/bash-completion/completions"
$ cp truckersmp-cli.bash "${XDG_DATA_HOME:-~/.local/share}/bash-completion/completions/truckersmp-cli"
```

##### zsh

Copy `_truckersmp-cli` to a directory that is part of `$fpath` and run `compinit`.

## Usage examples

### Basic

#### Everything default

To just try out TruckersMP (ETS2) on Linux with nothing already downloaded you can simply run `truckersmp-cli` which will download everything needed to get you going with Proton and a native Steam installation.

#### Install and update Euro Truck Simulator 2

```
$ truckersmp-cli update ets2mp
```

#### Start American Truck Simulator with TruckersMP

```
$ truckersmp-cli start atsmp
```

#### How to downgrade games

When the latest game version is not compatible with TruckersMP yet, the user can downgrade the games with `truckersmp-cli downgrade [game name]` which installs the latest version that is supported by TruckersMP by determining the Steam game branch name by using [TruckersMP Web API][truckersmp:webapi].

```
$ truckersmp-cli downgrade ets2mp
```

`--beta` option can be used to specify the branch name directly.

```
$ truckersmp-cli --beta temporary_1_39 downgrade ets2mp
```

If both options are given, the branch name from `--beta` option is used.

### Advanced

#### Install, update and start TruckersMP (ATS) with Proton from a custom location

```
$ truckermsp-cli --gamedir "/path/to/gamedir" ustart atsmp
```

#### Start TruckersMP (ETS2) using Wine

```
$ truckersmp-cli --wine start ets2mp
```
Make sure that
* The Windows version of Steam is already running in the same Wine prefix **or**
* The Windows version of Steam is installed in `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam` in the same Wine prefix **or**
* You're specifying the path to the Window version of Steam with `--wine-steam-dir`

#### Using a different prefix location

```
$ truckersmp-cli --proton --prefixdir "/path/to/prefix" start ets2mp
$ truckersmp-cli --wine --prefixdir "/path/to/prefix/pfx" start ets2mp
```
* While the prefix for Wine will point directly to the prefix location, Proton uses a subfolder `pfx` for the actual prefix and points to the parent folder.
* Your prefix must be 64bits, the mod is not 32bits-compatible.

## Rendering backends

### OpenGL (default)

* Stable and faster than wined3d. But slower than DXVK.
* Useful if you're not using Vulkan-capable GPU.

### Direct3D 11 (DXVK or wined3d)

* Faster than OpenGL when DXVK is used.
    * DXVK requires Vulkan support.
    * DXVK 1.4.6 or newer is needed because older versions have rendering issue. If you're using Proton, use 4.11-10 or newer.
* Proton uses DXVK by default.
    * When using Proton, wined3d can be used by specifying `--use-wined3d`, but it's not recommended because this is slower than OpenGL.
* Used only when `-d` or `--enable-d3d11` is specified.

## Configuration file

It's possible to set various game settings and third party programs in a configuration file.

The configuration file format is similar to the INI format known from Windows with several sections `[section]` containing key-value-pairs `key = value`.
All sections are optional and a key-value-pair has to be in a section.
Boolean values can be `{yes,no}`, `{true,false}`, `{on,off}` and `{1,0}`.

### Default configuration file path

The default search path for the file is `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/truckersmp-cli/truckersmp-cli.conf`.

### Sections for game modes

Supported sections are `[ats]`, `[atsmp]`, `[ets2]` and `[ets2mp]`.
Settings in `[DEFAULT]` will be applied to all game modes if the game mode specific sections exist.

#### Optional game mode settings

Key-Value-Pair|Description
---|---
`without-rich-presence = [boolean]`|Disable Discord Rich Presence for the game mode - overriding what is set in third party sections.<br><br>Default: `no`
`game-directory = [path]`|Choose a different directory for the game files<br><br>Default: `$XDG_DATA_HOME/truckersmp-cli/(Game name)/data`
`prefix-directory = [path]`|Choose a different directory for the prefix<br><br>Default: `$XDG_DATA_HOME/truckersmp-cli/(Game name)/prefix`
`game-options = [options]`|Specify ATS/ETS2 options<br><br>Default: `-nointro -64bit`
`rendering-backend = {auto,dx11,gl}`|Choose a rendering backend<br><br>Default: `auto` (OpenGL is used when this is not specified for the game in the configuration file)
`proton-directory = [path]`|Choose a different Proton directory<br><br>Default: `$XDG_DATA_HOME/truckersmp-cli/Proton`
`steamruntime-directory = [path]`|Choose a different Steam Runtime directory for Proton 5.13 or newer
`disable-steamruntime = [boolean]`|Don't use Steam Runtime even when using Proton 5.13 or newer<br><br>Default: `no`
`disable-proton-overlay = [boolean]`|Disable Steam Overlay when using Proton<br><br>Default: `no`
`log-file = [path]`|Write log into the specified file, `-vv` option is recommended<br><br>Default: Empty string (only stderr)<br>Note: Messages from Steam/SteamCMD won't be written, only from this script (Game logs are written into `My Documents/{ETS2,ATS}MP/logs/client_*.log`)
`truckersmp-directory = [path]`|Choose a different directory for the mod files<br><br>Default: `$XDG_DATA_HOME/truckersmp-cli/TruckersMP`

### Sections for third party programs

Third party programs in the configuration file will get started together with the game.
Sections should follow the format `[thirdparty.gamemode.programname]` (one game mode) or `[thirdparty.programname]` (all game modes).

#### Required third party settings

Key-Value-Pair|Description
---|---
`executable = /path/to/my.exe`|Path to the executable where the path is either an absolute unix path (`/path/to/my.exe`), a relative unix path (`program/my.exe`) to `$XDG_DATA_HOME/truckersmp-cli/` or an absolute windows path (`C:\Program Files (x86)\program\my.exe`) within the prefix.

#### Optional third party settings

Key-Value-Pair|Description
---|---
`wait = [seconds]`|Set a minimal waiting time before the game will be started so third party programs have enough time to fully start up and log in.
`wants-rich-presence = [boolean]`|Set that a program supports Discord Rich Presence.

### Example configuration file

# before starting the game
[thirdparty.ets2mp.trucksbook]
executable = C:\Program Files (x86)\TrucksBook Client\TB Client.exe
wait = 30

# Start a program from "$XDG_DATA_HOME/truckersmp-cli/my program/" and
